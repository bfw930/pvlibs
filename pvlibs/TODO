Develop additional node types (device, experiment, ...) and test relational mapping and search


###
### update process file to enable import template extract multiple measurements from single file
### parse functions return list of nodes to add
### add function returns list of node indicies
###



Include graceful exception handling and partial file import with comments upon failure

    in particular, spline fit for charge density derivative in sinton lifetime data processing is unstable



Impliment additional data sources (measurement types, file formats)


    current-voltage

        parse data files (HALM, WaveLabs)

        calculate parameters from data (jsc, voc, ff, eta, mpp, rs, rp)


    lifetime

        parse data files (sinton lifetime, both xlsm and ltr)

        calculate lifetime from raw photovoltage decay

        model charge density versus lifetime with detailed model to extract fitting component parameters


    photoluminescence imaging

        parse data files (tiff, png)

        process images (edge alignment, apply psf)

        implied Voc map
